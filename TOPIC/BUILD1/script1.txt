TOPIC: ~socea 0x3 -240169237 9 0 7345 socea.top
" all " 01Z u: ( what is ~socea ? ) It is the current School of Civil Engineering and Architecture in Adama Science and Technology University. `06C u: ( [ when how ] * ~socea established ? ) The ASTU School of civil engineering and architecture is restructured on November 2014 containing eight programs namely: Structure Engineering, geotechnical Engineering, hydraulics & environmental Engineering, construction technology and management, irrigation Engineering and river basin development, Architecture, urban planning and design, geomatics Engineering. Currently, it comprise 4947 active UG students 140 academic staff member. `03n u: ( [ how_many list ] * departments * in ~soeec ) There are six departments in SOCEA namely Construction technology and management,Urban planning and design,Architecture,Civil engineering,Water resource engineering and Geomatics engineering. `0bJ u: ( [ what_is tell_me_about ] ~cotm ) Construction Technology & Management is designed to deliver integrated technology and management of construction. While technology refers to methods or procedures of techniques applied to bring the best result, management is to plan, organize control and administer a number of different components such as resources, processes, desires, and their combined performance by using human and non-human energy in order to accomplish the optimum results. Construction management is mostly concerned with specifying project objectives and plans including delineation of scope, budgeting, scheduling, setting performance requirements, and selecting project participants, maximizing the resource efficiency through procurement of labor, materials and equipment, implementing various operations through proper coordination and control. `0iT u: ( [ what_is tell_me_about ] ~upd ) Urban planning is a technical and political process concerned with the use of land and design of the urban environment, including air, water, and the infrastructure passing into and out of urban areas such as transportation and distribution networks. It guides and ensures the orderly development of settlements and satellite communities which commute into and out of urban areas or share resources with it. It concerns itself with research and analysis, strategic thinking, architecture, urban design, public consultation, policy recommendations, implementation and management. Urban design is the process of designing and shaping cities, towns and villages. Whereas architecture focuses on individual buildings, urban design address the larger scale of groups of buildings, of streets and public spaces, whole neighbourhoods and districts, and entire cities, to make urban areas functional, attractive, and sustainable. Urban design is an inter-disciplinary subject that unites all the built environment professions, including urban planning, landscape architecture, architecture, civil and municipal engineering. Urban design demands a good understanding of a wide range of subjects from physical geography, through to social science, and an appreciation for disciplines, such as real estate development, urban economics, political economy and social theory. `0c2 u: ( [ what_is tell_me_about ] ~arch ) Architecture is an art and science of designing buildings and other structures, and it deals with planning, designing and constructing form, space and ambience to reflect functional, technical, social, environmental and aesthetic considerations. It requires the creative manipulation and coordination of materials and technology, and of light and shadow. The practice of architecture also encompasses the pragmatic aspects of realizing buildings and structures, including scheduling, cost estimation and construction administration. Documentation produced by architects, typically drawings, plans and technical specifications, defines the structure and/or behaviour of a building or other kind of system that is to be or has been constructed. Architecture brings together the knowledge of art, science & technology and humanity for buildings and structures. `0nS u: ( [ what_is tell_me_about ] ~civil ) Civil engineering is a professional engineering discipline that deals with the design, construction, and maintenance of the physical and naturally built environment, including works like roads, bridges, canals, dams, buildings etc. It is traditionally broken into several sub-disciplines including Structural Engineering and Geotechnical Engineering. Subjects related to structural engineering deals with the analysis and design of structures that support or resist loads. Structural Engineering is largely the implementation of mechanics to the design of the large structures that are fundamental to basic living, such as buildings, bridges, walls, dams, and tunnels. Structural engineering theory is based upon applied physical laws and empirical knowledge of the structural performance of different materials and geometries. Structural engineering design utilizes a number of simple structural elements to build complex structural systems. While subjects related to Geotechnical engineering associate with the behavior of soils under the influence of loading forces and soil-water interactions. This knowledge is applied to the design of foundations, retaining walls, earth dams, clay liners, and geosynthetics for waste containment. The goals of geotechnical engineers could range from the design of foundations and temporary excavation support, through route selection for railways and highways, to the increasingly important areas of landfill disposal of wastes and groundwater contamination. Geotechnical principles are important in civil engineering, but also has applications in military, mining, petroleum and other engineering disciplines that are concerned with construction occurring on the surface or within the ground. `05N u: ( [ what_is tell_me_about ] ~wre ) Water resources engineers are concerned with the structures and processes related to water supplies for human consumption and the removal of water for safety.Water resources engineering is a specialty of civil engineering that focuses on water supplies, irrigation and waste disposal. It also addresses methods for controlling water to avoid water-related damage and catastrophes. `0et u: ( [ what_is tell_me_about ] ~geom ) Geomatics engineering is a new information technology discipline in which engineers acquire, model, analyze, and manage spatially referenced information and apply the knowledge generated to a wide variety of functions. It uses terrestrial, marine, airborne, and satellite-based sensors to acquire spatial and other data. It then transforms the data into common information systems such as mapping or global positioning systems ( GPS ) with well-defined accuracy characteristics. Using satellites and other modern techniques, Geomatics engineers help airplane pilots to navigate the skies with increased safety; geophysicists to find underground petroleum reservoirs; and rescue teams to locate ships, aircraft, and land vehicles in distress. Geomatics engineers also monitor environmental problems by remote sensing, align high-precision large industrial machinery, manage computer-based information systems for land inventory and management, and monitor the stability of large structures using highly accurate positioning techniques. `000

Course distribution in each semester is well planned and structured to harness knowledge from the three spinoffs into computer science and engineering knowledge domain. Elective courses gives opportunity for program student to make more stable basement in one of the spinoffs for further study, without compromising computer science and engineering knowledge domain. CSE postgraduate program is flexible, student oriented, and research driven program. Except one course, all courses are elective. There are seven course clusters, supposedly specialty steams in the PG curriculum. Algorithm and computation Artificial Intelligence Software Engineering Systems and Networks Computer Architecture Computer Vision, Graphics and Robotics Network and Information Systems Security SIG Special interest groups: Special interest group, particularly research groups, are groups of people ( preferably not less than three ) who are devoted doing researches on specific areas in main and latest stream of CSE. An individual who is a professor on the area will lead the group.SIG group members are comprised of mainly program academic staff members, and PG and UG students. By its nature, SIGs are composed of multidisciplinary field of studies; hence members could come from different programs from the same school or even different schools. Each research group main duties are ( 1 ) making discussion on scientific research outputs including journals, seminar and conference papers, brain storming on current status on science and technology, ( 2 ) disseminating the knowledge the University community by conducting seminars and other means, ( 3 ) and actively participate in scientific paper publications in the respective focus areas. In the aspect of establishing and strengthening the program, these groups plays vital roles in developing and reviewing course contents, also standardizing and managing labs for both undergraduate and post graduate programs. Research groups grow in to a particular post graduate program, and eventually into a research center in the area. Currently, the following SIG are active in the program Intelligent Systems Data Science Cloud Computing and distributed system Network Science Computer vision and Robotics `0Np u: ( [ what_is tell_me_about ] ~epce ) The program of Electrical Power and Control Engineering ( EPCE ) is one of the three programs in the School of Electrical Engineering and Computing in Adama Science and Technology University. The Program is aimed in serving the country by producing engineers and researchers who are playing key roles in the various sectors of development in the country and also advanced the University’s reputation. The core strategy of the Program is to pursue its vision and mission to enhance its research, linkage with industry, academic and scholarly activities and become a center of excellence for its programs, thereby improving its eminence in national and international rankings. The program has three areas of specialization at master level, namely: ELECTRICAL POWER ENGINEERING CONTROL ENGINEERING POWER ELECTRONICS Power engineering, also called power systems engineering, is a subfield of energy engineering and electrical engineering that deals with the generation, transmission, distribution and utilization of electric power and the electrical devices connected to such systems including generators, motors and transformers. Although much of the field is concerned with the problems of power, the standard for large-scale power transmission and distribution across the modern world, a significant fraction of the field is concerned with the conversion between AC and DC power and the development of specialized power systems such as those used in aircraft or for electric railway networks. Control engineering or control systems engineering is the engineering discipline that applies control theory to design systems with desired behaviors. The practice uses sensors to measure the output performance of the device being controlled and those measurements can be used to give feedback to the input actuators that can make corrections toward desired performance. When a device is designed to perform without the need of human inputs for correction it is called automatic control ( such as cruise control for regulating the speed of a car ) . Multi-disciplinary in nature, control systems engineering activities focus on implementation of control systems mainly derived by mathematical modeling of systems of a diverse range. Its main focus is on automation of system, fuzzy logic, mechatronics, etc Power electronics is the application of solid-state electronics to the control and conversion of electric power. It is the bridge between electrical power and control engineering. It also refers to a subject of research in electronic and electrical engineering which deals with the design, control, computation and integration of nonlinear, time-varying energy-processing electronic systems with fast dynamics. In modern systems the conversion is performed with semiconductor switching devices such as diodes, thyristors and transistors. In contrast to electronic systems concerned with transmission and processing of signals and data, in power electronics substantial amounts of electrical energy are processed. An AC/DC converter ( rectifier ) is the most typical power electronics device found in many consumer electronic devices. The power range is typically from tens of watts to several hundred watts. In industry a common application is the variable speed drive ( VSD ) that is used to control an induction motor. The power ranges of VSDs start from a few hundred watts and end at tens of megawatts. The program has sufficient PhD staffs to teach and advise the students. Moreover, the laboratory facilities are too the standard and it is well organized. Currently, the university is also purchasing very huge high technology laboratory equipment. `0p2 u: ( [ what_is tell_me_about ] ~ece ) Electronics and Communication Engineering is one of the programs of School of Electrical Engineering & Computing that aims to integrate separate engineering fields to meet the joint demands made by the Electronics and Communication industries in today's world.
